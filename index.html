    I am a Professor (博导) in University of Science and Technology of China. I received B.Eng. from Beihang University in July 2015 and PhD from National University of Singapore in August 2019. I have about 
    100 
    publications appeared in several top conferences such as SIGIR, SIGKDD, WWW, and ACL, and journals including TKDE, TOIS, and TPAMI. I received the Best Paper Honourable Mention in SIGIR 2021 and Best Poster Award in WWW 2018. My research interests include information retrieval, data mining, and multi-media analytics, particularly in machine learning techniques and applications such as causal inference, graph neural networks, adversarial learning, multi-source learning, recommender systems, FinTech, and text mining. Moreover, I have served as the AC or SPC/PC-member for top-tier conferences including SIGIR, WWW, SIGKDD, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, ACL, and the invited reviewer for prestigious journals such as TOIS, TKDE, TPAMI, TNNLS, JASA, and Nature Sustainability.

	1. Hiring tenure-track faculties and postdocs in NLP/IR/DM. Requirements: <br>
	- With PhD degree (or graduate soon) <br>
	- At least three first-author papers on tier-1 conferences <br>
	We provide competitive salary, sufficient funding and student supports, and good career opportunities. <br><br>

	2. Hiring PhD students from USTC and masters. Requirements: <br>
  - Strong code ability (C/C++ or Python) <br>
  - English (CET-6 score 500+ or equal levels or <strong>proficient in using ChatGPT or similar tools</strong>) <br>
  - Determination to do high-quality research.<br><br>
  
  3. Hiring undergraduate interns. Requirements: <br>
  - Strong code ability (C/C++ or Python) <br>
  - Determination to do high-quality research or interested in practical applications<br>
  - Experience in high-level competitions (e.g., ACM-ICPC and KDD-Cup) will be considered.<br><br>

  I hope every student can receive the core ability of <strong>systematically analyzing and solving research/technical problems</strong>, meanwhile, have a <strong>colorful and healthy life</strong> during the study in my group. I encourage students to be communicative and active in the group. I support various <strong>group activities</strong>, especially sports like badminton, jogging, and basketball. Meanwhile, I will try my best to create <strong>internship or visiting opportunities</strong> for students seeking such experience.
